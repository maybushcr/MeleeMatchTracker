            <p>
                The problem that we are trying to solve is tracking matches played in the video gameSuper Smash Brothers Melee (to be referred to as Melee for short). Melee is a fighting gamewhere players pick characters from various Nintendo franchises, pick the stage to play on, andthen fight. The characters vary in the abilities they can do, and the stages vary in size andunique features. There are multiple possible rule sets for the fights, but the use case of thissystem is for competitive Melee games that follow a specific rule set, leaving most options andmaps available in the game off limits. So in this case each match will be played with two playersusing the “stock” system where each player is allocated a certain amount of lives (stocks), andeach time they are killed during the match they lose a stock and are revived. When one playerruns out of stocks they lose. In competitive each player is allocated four stocks.Since the point of this system is to track competitive games it’s important for it to not onlytrack individual matches, but also sets and tournaments. Sets are sequence of games played toa certain odd number of wins, usually best of three or five. An important aspect of sets in Meleeis the banning (striking) of stages that occurs. Before the first game of a set players playRock-Paper-Scissors (RPS), and the winner gets to be the first person to strike a stage. Theloser then proceeds to strike two stages, with the winner finally getting to strike one more stage.Since there are only five stages available for the first game of a set, this last strike is essentiallypicking the last stage left. In the following games the winner of the most recent match gets tostrike a stage, then the loser gets to pick the stage.Tournaments can be played in various formats. The most basic format is singleelimination, where each player gets a seeding and then put into a bracket where they face offagainst other players in sets. The winner of the set moves on and faces the adjacent winner.This continues until one person remains. The most popular format is double elimination wherewhen you lose in a set for the first time you are put into a second bracket, both brackets
                progress, then the winner of each bracket faces off for the grand finals. The tournament type willdetermine how one can parse the sets and matches associated with a tournament to figure outthe final standings.The security for the system would have three levels: admin, organizer, and user. Adminwould have complete control, and would be limited to the developer of the application so thatthey can make any changes they need. Organizer is for people that are running thetournaments and they would be able to insert and update tables such as player, match, set andtournament so that the information can be gathered. Lastly there is just the regular user whowould be able to read the tables. The handling by organizers and users would not actually bethrough the database directly, but either through the front end of the application or through aRESTful api.A system like this is very important for gathering various statistics that people areinterested in. People can analyze a wide variety of things from the overall win rates ofcharacters, to more individual things like what stages people perform on best. It can also serveas the back end for utilities that are made to track brackets so people can see who has won andlost and what the next matches are. The scope of the system is fairly broad. It should be able tobe used by anyone that is following the competitive Melee rules to track their matches, sets, andtournaments.Our queries could be used in a variety of ways by a lot of different kinds of users. Firstly,it could be used by the players themselves so they can learn about their performance throughqueries like what their win percent is on different stages or looking at what throw people make inrock paper scissors to learn their bias. Secondly, it could be used by tournament organizers forseeding of the players so that the brackets are more fair, and if it's an invitational they could usethe statistics of who is winning the most to see who is worthy of an invite. Lastly, it can just beused by anyone interested in the statistics, such as people looking to make a tier list of what thebest characters are or a caster of a match interested in finding out historical information ondifferent matchups between players so they can provide context to the viewers of tournaments.
